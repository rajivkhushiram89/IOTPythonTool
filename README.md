1 Aim 
 
The aim of this project is to write mini IoT applications using Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT in Python language.  
 
 
2 Requirements 
 Only Raspberry Pi model 3 should be used 
 
b. You must use Python 3.5 or >3.5 to complete the tasks. Older versions must not be used.

--setted up a database (SQLITE3 chosen) with relevant columns for humidity, temperature of the Raspberry Pi 
-- cron job to pull data from sense-hat at specific time interval -- see crontab_command.txt 
-- Raspberry Pi push notifications to my phone using Pushbullet when the room around  Raspberry Pi gets too cool
